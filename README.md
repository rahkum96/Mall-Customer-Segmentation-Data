# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Data
This project is part of the Kaggle Mall Customer Segmentation Data competition. K means are used to divide data points into discrete, non-overlapping groupings. One of the most common uses of K means clustering is client segmentation in order to gain a better understanding of them, which can then be used to boost the company's income.

### The data includes the following features:

1. Customer ID

2. Customer Gender

3. Customer Age

4. Annual Income of the customer (in Thousand Dollars)

5. Spending score of the customer (based on customer behaviour and spending nature)


### Approach:
- Reading the dataset
- EDA
- Finding the k- value by the elbow method
- Using kmeans cluster model 
- Visualized the different cluster
